## *Description*
*This project focuses on analyzing sentiment patterns in social media data using a dataset collected from Twitter. The objective is to leverage sentiment analysis to understand public opinion, track brand reputation, and identify trending topics. By visualizing sentiment distributions, we aim to provide insights into how various entities are perceived on social media.*

## *Overview*
*Social media platforms like Twitter are essential for brands and individuals to connect with their audience and receive feedback. Sentiment analysis helps in extracting valuable insights from tweets, allowing organizations to respond effectively to public sentiment. In this project, we analyze tweets to determine whether users express positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. The analysis also involves examining sentiment trends for different entities and topics.*

*The key objectives of this project are:*
- *To classify tweets into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.*
- *To visualize sentiment distribution across various entities.*
- *To understand public perception and identify key trends.*

## *Data Source*
*The dataset used in this project comprises tweets collected from Twitter. Each entry includes:*
- *`Tweet Text`: The content of the tweet.*
- *`Sentiment`: The sentiment label (Positive, Neutral, Negative).*
- *`Entity`: The topic or brand being discussed in the tweet.*

*Note: The dataset can be obtained from publicly available Twitter data or specific APIs for research purposes.*

*The analysis process includes the following steps:*
- *Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, converting text to lowercase, and removing special characters, URLs, and stopwords.*
- *Descriptive Statistics: Generating summary statistics to understand data distribution.*
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining sentiment distributions and identifying patterns.*
- *Word Clouds: Generating visual representations of frequently occurring words for positive and negative sentiments.*
- *Entity-Wise Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing sentiments across different entities to determine public perception.*

---

## *Visualization and Interpretation*
*Using visualization tools, we explore:*
- *Sentiment distribution across different entities.*
- *Word clouds to identify common words in each sentiment category.*
